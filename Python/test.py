# Python is a case sensitive language 
# true and True is not same  .....
#
# How spaces effect the python code? 
a =                   5 
print(  a   )

#1. spaces in the same line( not in the beginning)
#2. spaces that takes code to the next line (this will effect the output of thecode)
#3. spaces that is in the beginning of the line(indents)
# indentations are expected when a code belongs to certain group of 
# implementations.

# Python relies on indentation, defined by the whitespace at
# the beginning of a line, to establish the scope of code blocks.
