# Create program that calculates the grade letter of a student. 
# Ask user their grade as an integer number.
# Print `Not a valid grade` if the grade is lower than 0 or bigger than 100. 
# Print A+ if the grade is higher than 94
# Print A if the grade is in between 85 and 94 inclusive.
# print B if the grade is in between 75 and 84 inclusive
# print C if the grade is in between 65 and 74 inclusive. 
# print grade doesn't meet expectations when the grade is lower than 65.

# How many conditions are we going to cover? 
# 6
# Do these conditions depend on each other ? 
# Yes, they do.
# We are going to use elif condition.
