# Ask user to enter two equal integer variables,

# Note! By using elif statement we are telling python that both conditions 
# can't be True, so if the first condition is True, it doesn't check the 
# elif's condition.
# We could say that we use elif statement for conditions that depend on 
# each other so either one or the other one is True.
