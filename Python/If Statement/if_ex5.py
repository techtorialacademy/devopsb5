# In the factory we need to create a program that can 
# find if we can do the shipment and, if we can do the shipment
# it will tell us how many small package we should ship.
# First we need to get total kilogram of the shipment,
# to reach this total kilogram of shipment we can use small and big packages. 
# Every big package is 5 kilogram and every small packages is 1 kilogram.
# We have limited amount of small and big packages. 
# Ask user how many big and how many small package  they have.
# Ask user what is the total goal kilogram of the shipment.
# Print whether they can ship, if they can ship print how many small packages they need. 
# Assume big packages is used before small packages.
