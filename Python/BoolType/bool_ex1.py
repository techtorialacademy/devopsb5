#Problem 1: Even or Odd
# We will write a program that prints True when variable `number` is 
# even, and prints False when the number is odd. 
#Odd num: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13 etc.
#Even num: 2,4,6,8,10,12 etc.
number = 105

# Even numbers are perfectly divisible by 2, and odd numbers not.

is_even = number % 2 == 0

print(is_even)
