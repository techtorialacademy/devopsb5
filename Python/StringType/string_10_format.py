# Formating is sort of a short cut to embed values from other 
# data types in to string. 

# There is two ways we could format strings. 
# *1 using format method. 
# Ex: We will put curly braces in a string, 
# and those curly braces will be replaced by an argument 
# that we put in format method. 

s = "Today weather is {} fahrenheit."
print(s) # Today weather is {} fahrenheit.

print(s.format(84))#Today weather is 84 fahrenheit.
print(s.format("eighty four"))#Today weather is eighty four fahrenheit.

# Note! We could use more than one curly brace to format 
# strings, as well as using index for curly braces.
age = int(input("Enter your age"))
name = input("enter your name")
s2 = "My name is {} and my age is {}."
print(s2) #My name is {} and my age is {}.

print(s2.format(name,age))

s3 = "The brand of the laptop is {1}, and model year is {0}."

print(s3.format(2019,"Linux"))

# Second way to format strings is using f-strings.
# We still use curly braces but this time we add 
# the name of variables inside the curly braces.
fahr = 84
s = f"Today weather is {fahr} fahrenheit."
print(s) # Today weather is 84 fahrenheit.
