Git Key Terms:

Repository:
It contains each files in your project and stores your changes as history. 
Think of this as a folder that Git can track(follow) the changes, 
updates or deletes.

Local:
This refers to version of your project that is in your personal laptop. 
When you make changes in the local, they are not immediately available to anyone else. 
Changes need to be committed and pushed a remote repository first. 

Staging Environment: 
    Before you commit all the changes, you can decide which changes 
    will be included in commit by moving changes to staging environment. 
    Staging are is like preparation table, where you can line up 
    your changes, get ready for finalizing them. 

Commit: 
Once you are satisfied with changes you have made, then you can commit them.
A commit is like taking a picture of all the changes that you have made at 
the moment. 

Remote Repository: 
A version of your project that is on the internet or another network, 
often in the platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket. 
After committing changes locally, commits will be pushed to remote repo. 

Basic commands of Git: 
command is an order that we can execute in the terminal. 

git init:
    This initializes a new Git repository and begins tracking an existing 
    directory. 
    Adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses 
    the internal data structure required for versions control. 


git add:
    Adds changes in the directory(folder) to the staging area. It prepares 
    it for the commit. 
    syntax: git add filename
    ```
    git add git-day4.txt 
    ```
    We would want to add all the changes to the staging 
    environment. 
    ```
    git add -A
    ```

git commit: 
    Takes all the changes written in staging environment and saves them to the 
    local repository. 
    You should provide a message describing what this commit is for. 
    ```
    git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

git push:
    Pushes commits from your local repository to a remote repository. 
    For the first push to a new remote you might need to specify branch 
    as well. 
    First time: 
    ```
    git push origin main 
    ```
    All others:
    ```
    git push 
    ```

What is token? 
It is a string of characters that represents a specific permission or 
authorization. 
In git we can use PAT(Personal Access Token): A secure token 
that users generate to authenticate into their github account when 
using HTTPS protocol.
