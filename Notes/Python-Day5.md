# Logical Operators in Python

## and operator
- `and` operator checks if **all** conditions are True. For ex:
```py
# Let's write a program to see if a person can drive:
# In order to drive they must be over 15 years old and they must have a 
# valid license
age = 18
has_license = True
can_drive = has_license and age > 15

```

## or operator
- `or` operator checks if at least one condition is True. For ex:
```py
# A worker can get rest when it is weekend or when it is on holidays. 
is_holiday = True
is_weekend = False
can_rest = is_holiday or is_weekend
```

## not operator 
- Reverses the result of a boolean variable. For ex:
```py
b1 = True
b1 = not b1
print (b1) # False
b1 = not b1
print(b1) # True

```
# Notes:
```py
print ( True and not False) # True
print (not True and True) # False 
print ( True and True and True and False) # False 
print (True or False) # True
print (not False or False) # True
print (False or False) # False
print (False and False) # False

# Using both `and` and `or` operator at the same time.
# In python `and` operator will be executed before the or operator. 
print( False or True and False) #  False
#Note: not operator will be executed before the `and` and `or` operators.

```
