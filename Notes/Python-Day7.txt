String Variables

How to create a string variable? 
Every thing that is defined within the quotes(single,double,triple) can be 
assigned to a variable as string value. 

```py
s = "This is a string variable" 
print(len(s)) # 25
```
Note! len() function will give us the total number of characters in string.

We can individually access the characters in string. 

Accessing Elements in String 
In order to access elements in string we should use their index numbers. 

```py
#     123456       Length
#     012345       Index Numbers
pl = "python"
# What is the index number for fourth letter in string? 
# 3
#Note: Last(biggest) index number will be one
# smaller than length of the string. 
```
