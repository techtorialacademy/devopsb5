A variable in programming is like a container where we 
can store the data. 

Why do we use variables? 

1. Storage 
    Variables allow us to store data that we can use and modify 
    later. 
2. Readability
    Makes our code easier to understand, debug and find what the 
    data represents. 
    * debug mostly means going over the code again for the purpose of 
    understanding or finding the mistake. 
3. Reusability
    Once a value is sotred in a variable, you can use that variable 
    multiple times in different parts of your code. 

Formula Of The Variable Creation 
    variablename = value 

Naming A Variable
    Rules: 
        * Variable name cannot start with a number. 
        * It cannot have spaces. 
        * It can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscore(_).
            *alphanumeric: numbers and letters
        * Variable names are case sensitive which means 
        `age` is not same as `Age`. 

Naming Conventions
    * Convention -> how do you name the variable. 

There are 4 different types of naming conventions:
    
    1. Camel Case 
        Naming starts with a lower case and capitalizes each word after that. 
        Ex: firstName, lastName, areaCode etc. 
        Notes: Most Of java, javascript users

    2. Pascal Case 
        Naming starts with an upper case and capitalizes each word after that. 
        Ex: FirstName, LastName, AreaCode etc. 

    3. Snake Case 
        Each word in a variable name is separated by underscore (_). 
        Ex: first_name, last_name, area_code etc. 
        Note:Most of python users.
    
    4. Kebab Case 
        Each word in a variable name is separated by hyphen (-). 
        Ex: first-name, last-name, area-code etc. 
        

NOTE: When creating a variable type of variable is auto understood 
by python. 

Type of Numerical Variables
    1. Integer: Represents whole numbers. 
       Ex: age = 25
    2. Float: Represents real numbers.(Numbers with decimal points.)
       Ex: weight= 190.4 , avg = 8.0
    3. Complex: Represents complex numbers that has both 
       imaginary and real parts. 
       Ex: 5 + 4j -> 5 is the real part 4j is the imaginary part. 

Type Function
    The type() function is a built-in Python function 
    used to determine the data type of a variable. 
        Ex: a = 10
            print(type(a)) #Output <class 'int'> 
            b = 10.1
            print(type(b)) #Output <class 'float'> 
    Importance: 
        Helps debugging
        Useful when learning because it helps you to 
        understand how python works with data types. 

Creating Multiple Variables In Single Line 
    We can define multiple variable on a single line, 
    by separating them with commas(,). 
        Syntax: a,b,c = 1.1 , 1 , "h"        

    Advantage: 
        Reduce the line of your code.
        More readable
        Compact code

Assigning Multiple Variables With A Same Value 
    Ex: a = b = c = d = 5
        #in the line above variable a, b, c and d will 
        #be assigned with a value 5 and type of all Variables
        #will be integer. 

ReAssignment in Python 
    After variables assigned with a value, we can also
    assign a new value to them. 
    Ex: var1 = 6
        var1 = "d"
        var1 = 1.0
